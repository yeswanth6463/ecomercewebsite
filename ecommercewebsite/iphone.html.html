            <h5>Review:</h5>
            <p>Apple's annual iPhone reveal event is supposed to be one of the biggest moments in tech each year. At this year's show – the company's first in-person product launch since the beginning of the pandemic – the new iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus were two of eight new products jostling for space and attention. The iPhone 14 Plus is an all-new option in the lineup, offering the size benefits of the Pro Max models without some of the features and the associated cost, and so it's clearly the more interesting of the two new siblings. I've been able to spend over a month with both, the iPhone 14 and the iPhone 14 Plus. If you're wondering which of these to buy, or whether either of them is right for you, read on
                iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus price in India
                It's interesting that Apple did not launch the iPhone 14 in India at higher prices than the iPhone 13, considering inflation and international currency exchange changes over the past year – and even more so considering the iPhone 14 Pro (Review) and iPhone 14 Pro Max are each more expensive than their predecessors. That said, prices are still extremely high by Indian standards. The iPhone 14 officially starts at Rs. 79,900 with 128GB of storage, and you'll have to pay Rs. 89,900 for 256GB or Rs. 1,09,900 if you want 512GB.
